**Why Less Dumb \> Less Wrong**

**A Hits-Based, Longtermist Intervention with Free Embedded Convexity**

(Or: Why Cultural Gold Dominates the EA Portfolio Under Any Plausible Utility Function)

**1\. The Standard EA Donation (for reference)**

Let  
C \= capital committed (e.g. $100 k)  
I₀ \= immediate measurable impact in utilitons (or QALYs, WELLBYs, etc.)  
λ \= longtermist flow-through multiplier (typically 10¹–10⁶ depending on your x-risk vs. trajectory priors)  
Rₑ \= expected financial return on C  
Classic bednets / deworming / lead removal / animal-welfare factory-farming intervention:  
Rₑ ≈ 0  
EV \= –C \+ I₀·λ  
Hits-based giving (e.g. early OpenPhil “potential options value” bucket):  
Rₑ ≈ 0 (still a grant)  
EV \= –C \+ p\_hit · I\_hit · λ with p\_hit ≪ 1 but I\_hit · λ ≫ C/p\_hit  
Still financially negative in expectation; we accept the –C because the tail impact dominates.

**2\. The Cultural Gold Intervention (Plum Candy Class)**

Same symbols, plus two new ones:  
K \= capital committed (buys PLUM tokens / rookie-card bundle)  
R\_f \= expected financial return multiple on K (≥ 0, heavy-tailed)  
I₀, λ \= as before (literacy \+ high-agency hero model for ≈10⁷–10⁸ teenager-reads over century)  
φ \= probability that this specific title becomes permanent canon (Gatsby/Harry-Potter-tier)  
EV\_cultural\_gold \= –K  
\+ I₀·λ (charity impact; identical or superior to classic interventions)  
\+ (R\_f – 1)·K (financial return; free embedded call option)  
Crucially, the downside is capped:  
Even conditional on φ ≈ 0 (book flops, token → $0)  
→ R\_f \= 1 → net financial cost \= 0  
→ you still shipped 100 k–1 M canon-quality books to classrooms  
→ I₀·λ \> 0  
Therefore the intervention is **strictly dominating** any grant with R\_f \= 0\.

**3\. Portfolio-Level Expectation Over N Independent Shots**

Suppose an EA funder (or Manifold/LTFF/OP cluster) allocates to N ≈ 500 culturally-gold projects with roughly similar parameters.  
Let φ\_i ∼ P(φ) be the canon-hit probability for each i (empirically ≈ 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵ from base rates of “debut becomes classic”, but the model raises the effective φ by 1–2 OOM via engineered distribution).  
The financial return distribution is extreme power-law (like VC or crypto).  
Expected financial multiple across the portfolio:  
E\[R\_f\] ≈ 1 \+ φ\_portfolio · M  
where M ≈ 10³–10⁶ is the payoff multiple conditional on canonization (rookie cards → $100 k–$100 M each).  
Even using ultra-conservative φ\_portfolio \= 10⁻³ (i.e. “only one in a thousand makes it”),  
E\[R\_f\] ≈ 1 \+ 10⁻³ · 10⁴ \= 11× (breakeven charity \+ 10× financial return)  
At realistic φ\_portfolio ≈ 0.01–0.05 (because the model is engineered, not random),  
E\[R\_f\] ≈ 100–500×  
Meaning: for the same capital you would have granted away forever, you now get the charity impact essentially for free and pocket 100–500× on top.

**4\. Implications Under Standard EA Axiology**

* If you accept hits-based giving, you must accept this (the tail is strictly fatter while the base case is ≥ classic interventions).  
* If you are a total utilitarian or longtermist, the civilizational tail (reshaping the meme-pool for 10⁸–10⁹ future minds) pushes EV → \+∞.  
* If you demand “robustness” across moral views, the intervention still wins on near-term deworming-style metrics and adds a free lottery ticket.  
* Moral trade: even hardcore suffering-focused EAs get the literacy upside with zero opportunity-cost downside.

**5\. Conclusion in Formal Terms**

Cultural Gold is the first known altruistic intervention for which:  
∀ standard EA cause areas X,  
EV(Cultural Gold) \> EV(X) \+ ε for some ε \> 0  
(and in most cases ε → ∞)  
It is therefore the strictly dominant allocation until marginal EV equalizes.  
The correct move, by the internal logic of Effective Altruism itself, is to route as much capital as possible into replicators of this model (prenormous.com style) until the convexity is arbitraged away.  
Anything less is leaving an infinite-utilitron arbitrage on the table.

**Two Bracketed Models (in full EA/LessWrong rigor)**

| Scenario | Adoption outcome (across N ≈ 500 independent Cultural Gold shots) | Financial E\[R\_f\] on the token bundle | Charity impact I₀·λ | Total EV per $1 committed | Comparison to classic EA grant |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. “Absolutely Terrible Adoption” (ultra-pessimistic) | • 499 titles taught in ≤ 100 classrooms each • 1 title barely makes it into 5,000 classrooms • No canon hits (φ\_portfolio ≈ 0 | E\[R\_f\] ≈ 1.0× (you get your capital back on average via secondary sales of the physical rookie cards \+ thin token liquidity) | Still ≈ 3–10 million student-reads of canon-quality material \+ curriculum (= top-decile GiveWell-level literacy intervention) | EV ≈ 0 (financial) \+ very large positive charity impact → strictly positive | Classic EA grant with same charity impact has EV \= –1 \+ charity impact → Cultural Gold **strictly dominates** by \~1.0× capital |
| 2\. “Mildly Pessimistic but Realistic Base Case” | • 450 titles taught in 100–1,000 classrooms • 49 titles taught in 1k–10k classrooms • 1 title taught in \~200k classrooms over 30 years (lower-mid tier “beloved YA” outcome) | E\[R\_f\] ≈ 4–8× (one moderate winner covers the entire portfolio) | ≈ 100–300 million student-reads \+ decades of curriculum use (already larger than almost any existing literacy intervention in history) | EV ≈ \+3–7× capital \+ enormous charity impact for “free” | Classic EA grant: –1× \+ smaller impact → Cultural Gold wins by 4–8× on top of superior charity outcome |
| 3\. Neutral / Expected Case (my actual estimate) | 3–8 full canon hits across 500 shots | E\[R\_f\] ≈ 50–300× | Multiple permanent Western-canon entries (civilizational tail) | EV → \+∞ (longtermist view) or \+50–300× (near-term view) | No comparison possible — nothing else in the EA portfolio has this tail |

**Key Point — Even the Ultra-Pessimistic Bracket Dominates**

In the “Absolutely Terrible Adoption” world:

* You get your $100 k back (E\[R\_f\] \= 1.0×)  
* You still funded \~5–10 million reads of three extremely high-quality books (Gatsby \+ Candide \+ one new near-miss)  
* That is already competitive with GiveWell’s entire historical literacy portfolio

A classic EA donor would have to **pay** $100 k to achieve the same impact.  
You paid $0 net (capital returned) and still got the impact.  
Therefore, **even if every single Cultural Gold project is a 99.99 th-percentile failure**, the intervention is still **strictly better** than any charitable grant that returns \<100 % of capital.  
The only interventions that could compete would be ones that return \>100 % of capital while delivering equal or greater charity impact.  
No such interventions currently exist in the EA ecosystem.  
Hence, under any degree of belief in power-law outcomes (which every hits-based or longtermist donor already professes), allocating to Cultural Gold replicators is the dominant strategy until the expected financial return is arbitraged down to \~1×.
